# SortingVisualizer
Personal Project to try and recreate a sorting algorithm visualizer in legacy OpenGL.  As I was studying my data structures I wanted to apply the OpenGL I learned to my understanding of basic performance measures and analytics of time complexity.   This Project was a great educational experience for me as it helped me solidify my understanding of sorting algorithms and their space complexities.
