# OpenGL Sorting Algorithm Visualizer with C++
Personal Project to try and recreate a sorting algorithm visualizer in legacy OpenGL from scratch.  As I was studying my data structures and algorithms I wanted to apply the OpenGL I learned to my understanding of basic performance measures and analytics of time complexity.   This Project was a great educational experience for me as it helped me solidify my understanding of sorting algorithms and their timecomplexities.
